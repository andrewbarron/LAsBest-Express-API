# Breakdown
My Restaurant API was created to work with my client to create, display & store your favorite restaurants. I also added a feature that allows you to create reviews that live within each restaurant. I build my app with authentication so that only you can update and delete the restaurants that you create. Also you can only update and delete the reviews that you create.
